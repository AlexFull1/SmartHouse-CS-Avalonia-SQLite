Description
This project is an interface for a smart home application. The application consists of three buttons (Add, Edit, and Delete) and a table displaying information about the equipment in each room.

Clicking the Add button opens a new window where the user can enter data for a new room.
To delete a room, the user needs to select it in the table and click the Delete button.
The Edit button is currently not functional.
The project is in an early development stage and requires further work.
To refresh the displayed data, the application must be restarted.
